## State management

Takes advantage of Preact's reactive primitives.
Signals can be defined in separate files and imported in components that subscribe to changes by reading their value, without needing to pass them down as props or context
Local state can be managed with `useSignal()` and `useComputed()` as described in the [docs](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/#local-state-with-signals)
